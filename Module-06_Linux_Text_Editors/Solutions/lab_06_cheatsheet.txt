# Solution Overview for Lab 06 (Interactive)

Since Vim is an interactive tool, this cannot be automated with a script easily.
Here are the keystrokes you would use:

1. `vim vim_practice.txt`
2. `i`
3. (Type content)
4. `Esc`
5. `:w` <Enter>
6. Move cursor to second line (use arrows or `j`).
7. `dd`
8. `u`
9. `G` (Shift+g) -> `o` (open new line below) -> Type "The End" -> `Esc`
10. `:wq` <Enter>
