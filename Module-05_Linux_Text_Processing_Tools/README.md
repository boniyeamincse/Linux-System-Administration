# Module 05: Linux Text Processing Tools

## Topics Covered
- Standard Input (stdin), Output (stdout), Error (stderr)
- Redirecting Output to a File (`>`, `>>`)
- Constructing and Using Pipelines (`|`)
- Working with `tail`, `head`, `cat`, `less`, `wc`, `echo`
- Working with Regular Expressions `grep`
- Finding files with `find` and `locate`

## Concepts
- **Pipe (`|`)**: Passes the output of one command as input to the next.
  - Example: `ls -l | grep "txt"`
- **Redirection (`>`)**: Saves output to a file (overwrites).
- **Redirection (`>>`)**: Appends output to a file.
