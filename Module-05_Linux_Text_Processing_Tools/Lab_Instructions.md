Manipulate text streams and find data efficiently.

## Tasks

2.  Count how many lines are in `etc_files.txt`.
3.  Display the first 10 lines of `etc_files.txt`.
4.  Display the last 5 lines of `/var/log/syslog` (or `/var/log/dmesg` if syslog doesn't exist).
5.  Search for the word "root" in `/etc/passwd`.
6.  Find all files in `/var/log` that end with `.log`.
